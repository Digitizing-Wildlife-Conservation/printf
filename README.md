Concepts Covered
Throughout this project, we explored several key concepts:

Group Projects
Pair Programming
Flowcharts
Technical Writing
Project Requirements
All code is written in the C programming language.
Compilation is done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific flags.
The project strictly adheres to the Betty style for code formatting.
No use of global variables is allowed.
Each C file contains no more than 5 functions.
The main entry point for the program is in the main.c file.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open a terminal and compile the project using the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o custom_printf
Run the compiled program:
./custom_printf
Example Output
Below is an example of the expected output when running the program with the provided main.c file:
Let's try to printf a simple sentence.
